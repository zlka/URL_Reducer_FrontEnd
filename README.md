# URL Reducer

*The backend repo can be found here : [URL Reducer](https://github.com/Mounaiyk/URL_shortener_backend)*

## Project Aims

The project involved users entering a url which then returns a shortened URL:

- The backend will then generate a shortened path 

- No login should be required to create a shortened URL

- If User tries to access your website with a path you have stored in your database, they should get rerouted to the URL it relates to

- If User tries to access your website with a path you do not have stored in your database, they should get rerouted to the homepage where they can create a new short URL
